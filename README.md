## :bulb: Challenges
- The challenges that I faced building this app was related to state management. 
- I used Provider and I had two of them, one for the recipes and the other for saving them. 

## :technologist: Todo
- :white_large_square: Add Authentication
- :white_large_square: Finish the ProfileScreen
- :white_large_square: Implement the Search logic on the HomeScreen
- :white_large_square: MAYBE connect the app with a db - Sqflite or Hive?
